# GPF: Genotypes and Phenotypes in Families

The Genotype and Phenotype in Families (GPF) system manages large databases
of genetic variants and phenotypic measurements obtained from collections
of families and individual family members.

The main application of the system has been in managing the data gathered from
the Simons Simplex Collection, a collection of ~2,600 families with one child
diagnosed with autism.

Information on how to use GPF could be found in the
[GPF documentation](https://iossifovlab.com/gpfuserdocs/)
