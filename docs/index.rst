GPF: Genotypes and Phenotypes in Families
=========================================

GPF (Genotypes and Phenotypes in Families) is an open-source platform
that manages genotypes and phenotypes derived from collections of families.
The GPF interface allows interactive exploration of genetic variants,
enrichment analysis for de novo mutations, and phenotype/genotype
association tools. In addition, GPF allows researchers to share their data
securely with the broader scientific community. See the `The Genotype and
Phenotypes in Families (GPF) platform manages the large and complex data
at SFARI <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.08.579330v1>`_
for a detailed description.

GPF is an open-source project available at
`GitHub <https://github.com/iossifovlab/gpf>`_
developed by Iossifov's
group at CSHL and Seqpipe Ltd, Sofia, Bulgaria.

GPF is deployed at the Simons Foundation (https://gpf.sfari.org), providing
protected access to comprehensive genotypic and phenotypic data for the
SSC, SPARK, and related datasets.
