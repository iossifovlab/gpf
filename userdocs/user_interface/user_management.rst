Groups
------

Groups are entities that associate users with datasets.
If a user wishes to access a certain dataset, he has to belong to a group
containing that dataset. Users and datasets can be in multiple groups
simultaneously.

When a new user or dataset is created, they are automatically assigned to
groups with their corresponding names.

Special Groups
++++++++++++++


Admin
^^^^^
Users assigned to the admin group, have all permissions.
Only admin users can view or interact with other users, groups or datasets.

Anonymous
^^^^^^^^^

*anonymous@seqpipe.org* is a group that all unregistered users belong to.
They lack permissions for accessing most of the datasets.
Inaccessible datasets are shown in grey color.

Hidden
^^^^^^

Datasets could belong to a group called `hidden`.
This group indicates which datasets should stay hidden (instead of showing them
in grey color) in the dropdown menu on the dataset page for users
without access permissions.

In this case, *Denovo DB Dataset* is an option for the registered user,
as opposed to when an anonymous user is opening the menu in the previous
example.


Any user
^^^^^^^^

Certain datasets are visible to every registered user.
They belong to the *any_user* group which is automatically assigned to every
account and cannot be removed.

Any dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^

*any_dataset* is a group that contains all of the available datasets.
Admins are usually subscribed to this group.


Sorting groups
++++++++++++++

In the *Groups* tab on the *Management* menu, the groups column can be sorted
by clicking on the arrows at the end of the *Group* column title.

alphabetically in descending order, while the up arrow sorts them in ascending
order.


Dataset access
--------------

In the *Datasets* tab on the *Management* menu, GUI users can observe
information about which users have access to a dataset or which groups
does a dataset belong to.


Adding group to a dataset
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
In the *Datasets* tab, by typing group names in the text bar in the
'Groups with access' column, and then clicking 'Add', existing groups can
be assigned to datasets.
