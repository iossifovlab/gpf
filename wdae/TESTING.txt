TESTING
=======


1) Most of the tests in wdae are in api/tests directory. Some of them 
use django testing framework. Most are pure python unit tests. So these
tests can be re-located in other place if neccessary.

2) Most of the tests are included in api.tests module. To run them use (from 
wdae/ directory):

python manageWDAE.py test api.tests

3) There are some tests for enrichment, that compare new enrichment computations
with old implementation. To run them use:

python manageWDAE.py test api.tests.enrichment_tests

4) There are standard test coverage tool for python applications called 'coverage'.
To install it use:

pip install coverage

5) To check the test coverage from wdae/ directory call:

coverage run --source='..' manageWDAE.py test api.tests

This will generate coverage data in the file '.coverage', that is not human
readable.

6) To generate html coverage report from wdae/ directory call:

coverage html

The coverage report is generated in htmlcov/ sub-direcrory.
