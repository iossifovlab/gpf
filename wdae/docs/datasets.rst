Datasets
========

In the *Datasets* tab on the *Management* menu, GUI users can observe
information about which users have access to a dataset or which groups
does a dataset belong to.


Adding group to a dataset
--------------------------
In the *Datasets* tab, by typing group names in the text bar in the 'Groups with access'
column, and then clicking 'Add', existing groups can be assigned to datasets.
